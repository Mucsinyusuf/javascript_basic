//arithemtic operators
// arithemtic operatorions are operatersions you can do betwenn two numbers
// addition (+)
//subtraction(-)
//multiplication(*)
//division(/)
// modulo(%)

// incrementing (++)
let value = 5
value++
console.log(value)

// decrementing (--)
let value1 = 6;
value1--
console.log(value1)

// exponentiation(**)
//this raises the first nmber to the power of the second number
console.log(value1 ** 5)

// Equality Operators
// == vs ===
// == converts the variable to the same data types 
// === compares data types 
value2 = '5' == 5;
value3 = 5 === 5;
console.log(value3) 

// comparing values 
// We can also compare values with >, <, >=, <=.

// Greater than: >,
// Lesser than: <,
// Greater than or equal to: >=,
// Lesser than or equal to: <=.


// The || operator in JavaScript is the logical OR operator. 
// It is used to evaluate two expressions and returns true if at least one of the expressions is true.
//  If both expressions are false, it returns false.

// The && operator in JavaScript is the logical AND operator. 
//It is used to evaluate two expressions and returns true only if both expressions are true. 
//If at least one of the expressions is false, it returns false.

// The ! operator in JavaScript is the logical NOT operator. 
//It is used to invert the boolean value of an expression. 
// If the expression is true, the ! operator will return false, 
// and if the expression is false, it will return true.
